// Timing the frame instead of reasoning about it.
//
// Perf is the port's profiler, and it exists because the first guess about
// where a frame goes is usually wrong: the first time this was measured, the
// renderer took 6 ms and the four lines of text reporting on it took 13.
//
// It is OPT-IN. Add 'HLDS_PROFILE=1' to the defines in build.py to build it
// in; without that every entry point below is an empty inline and the shipped
// ROM carries none of it. Sections are a fixed enum rather than strings so
// that a scope costs two timer reads and an add.
