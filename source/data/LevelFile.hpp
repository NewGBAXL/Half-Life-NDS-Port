// The cooked level in memory.
//
// A level is one heap block: load() reads its pieces out of the map's archive
// (HlLevel.hpp: "level.0", "level.1"...), one after another into their places,
// and hands the bytes to LevelView::open (shared/HlLevelReader.hpp), which
// checks them and points into them. Nothing is parsed or copied after that,
// and unload() is one free.
//
// Only one level is ever loaded; `level` is it.
