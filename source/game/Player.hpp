// The player on the console: the shared movement code (HlPlayerMove.hpp) fed
// from the DS's input, and the camera placed at its eyes.
//
// The movement itself is not here. It lives in shared/ so the host tests run
// it; this class only gathers what it needs each frame -- the keys, the view
// direction, how much time has passed -- and is the one translation unit that
// instantiates it for the ARM9 (PlayerMove.itcm.arm.cpp).
//
// TIME STEP. The move is run once per rendered frame with the real time that
// frame took, in whole vblanks. Half-Life's movement is written for a variable
// step, and stepping with the frame keeps the view smooth at 60 fps without
// interpolating between ticks; the split gravity step keeps a jump the same
// height at 30.
