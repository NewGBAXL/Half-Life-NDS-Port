// The text readout over the 3D picture: frame rate, what the renderer chose
// and what the hardware made of it.
//
// It prints ONE ROW at a time, a few frames apart, and that is not a nicety:
// the libnds console costs about 13 ms for the whole readout, most of a frame.
// Printed every frame it halved the frame rate it was reporting; printed all
// at once it would still cost a frame now and then, and in two-pass mode a
// missed frame shows the two halves of the screen out of step.
