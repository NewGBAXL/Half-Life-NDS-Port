// Geometry-engine command streams: the packer that writes them and a decoder
// that reads them back.
//
// A surface in a cooked level is not a list of vertices for the DS to turn into
// commands -- it IS the commands, packed the way the hardware's FIFO takes
// them, so that drawing a surface is copying its words to one register. This
// file is the only place that knows the encoding.
//
// PACKED FORMAT (GBATEK, "GXFIFO / Packed Commands"): one word holds up to four
// command bytes, lowest byte first, and is followed by the parameter words of
// each in order. A zero byte ends the word's commands. The hardware has one
// rule that bites: the top-most command of a packed word must take parameters.
// Every command emitted here does, so the rule cannot be broken from outside.
//
// VERTEX POSITIONS are sent in the shortest form that is EXACT. The full form,
// VTX_16, is two parameter words; the hardware has four one-word forms, and a
// level's command stream is half its size on the card and in RAM, so they are
// worth having:
//
//   VTX_XY/XZ/YZ  two coordinates; the third is the previous vertex's
//   VTX_DIFF      three signed 10-bit differences from the previous vertex
//                 (+-512 raw: 128 units at our quarter-unit scale)
//   VTX_10        three 10-bit coordinates: exact only for multiples of 64 raw
//
// The relative forms need a previous vertex, so a stream's FIRST vertex is
// always absolute. That is what makes each surface's stream self-contained:
// the DS sends surfaces in whatever subset and order the frame calls for.
//
// The decoder exists so that the converter can check its own output (`verify`
// and the tests) by reading streams the way the console will, instead of
// trusting the code that wrote them.
