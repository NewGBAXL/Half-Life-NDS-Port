// The map's path nodes, and the ways between them.
//
// The game's maps mark where a monster may stand with info_node entities and
// leave the engine to work out, when the map is first run, which can be
// walked between; it writes what it found beside the map
// (maps/graphs/<map>.nod), and those files come with the game. Where there
// is one, the nodes and links are taken from it (NodGraph.hpp) -- with the
// doors and breakable things each link passes through, and which sizes of
// creature each is for. (Each link is also tried with the very walk the DS
// makes, over the world alone, and those the trial cannot make are counted:
// they are kept, being nearly always over a floor that is a brush entity.)
// Where there is none, the links are worked out here as they always were.
//
// Either way one thing is added that the game has not got: a way DOWN, from
// a node at the top of a ledge to one at its foot, one way only.
//
// No table of routes is made. The console finds its way when it needs one
// (HlWalk.hpp, pathStep), over the links as they are at that moment.
