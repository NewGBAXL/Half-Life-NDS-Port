// Lightmaps to vertex colours.
//
// GoldSrc lights a face with a small texture, one RGB sample every 16 units.
// The DS has no second texture stage and nowhere near the texture memory to
// bake light into the first, so each vertex takes the lightmap's value at that
// vertex and the hardware interpolates across the polygon. Faces are at most
// 240 units across (the map compiler splits them for the lightmap's sake), so
// what is lost is detail inside a face, not the overall light.
//
// LIGHT STYLES. A face carries up to four lightmap layers, one per style. Style
// 0 is plain light. 1..31 flicker or pulse; 32 and up belong to lights a
// button switches. What is baked into a vertex is its light as the map
// starts (a switched light that starts off left out, a flickering one at its
// steady strength); and for every vertex such light reaches, the level's
// LightPatch section says what each style adds, so that the console can work
// its colour out again as they change (sampleLayers, changingLayers).
