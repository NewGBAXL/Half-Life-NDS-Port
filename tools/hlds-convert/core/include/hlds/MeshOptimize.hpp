// Fewer vertices for the same picture.
//
// The DS runs out of VERTICES before it runs out of polygons (6144 a pass),
// and a map compiler's output is wasteful in exactly that currency: it cuts
// every large face into pieces no more than 240 units across so that each can
// carry a lightmap, and the DS then pays four vertices for every piece. There
// are no lightmaps here -- light is baked into the vertices -- so much of that
// cutting buys nothing. This file takes back what can be taken back WITHOUT
// CHANGING WHAT IS DRAWN, in three steps:
//
//  1. MERGE two coplanar faces of one texture across a shared edge, when the
//     result is still convex and the light on it is affine -- one plane of
//     colour over the whole polygon, to within one step of the DS's 5-bit
//     colour. An affine colour is drawn identically however the polygon is
//     cut into triangles, so the merged face shades as its parts did.
//     And only when it PAYS: two quads that would become a five-sided face
//     cost seven vertices merged and six as a strip, so they are left alone.
//     That is judged on the END result, not merge by merge (optimizeFaces).
//
//  2. DROP a vertex that lies in the middle of a straight edge, when EVERY
//     face that has a vertex there has it mid-edge too, and its colour is the
//     blend of its two neighbours' (same tolerance). The compiler puts such
//     vertices wherever another face's corner touches an edge; those must stay
//     -- remove one and the two faces no longer share an edge exactly, which
//     on this hardware is a line of background showing through. The rule keeps
//     them, because the touching corner is not mid-edge.
//
//  3. GROUP what is left by plane and texture, and send each group's quads as
//     strips that run from face to face, so that vertices on a shared edge are
//     sent once.
//
// Steps 1 and 2 are "guarded": they can be switched off (--geometry lossless),
// leaving only step 3, which never removes a vertex.
