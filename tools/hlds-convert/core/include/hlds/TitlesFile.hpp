// The game's titles.txt: what its messages say, and how each is shown -- the
// chapters' names, the names of the introduction, the hazard course's
// lessons. An env_message names one of them.
//
// The file is a run of settings ("$position -1 0.65", "$effect 2", ...) that
// stand until they are set again, and messages: a name on a line of its own,
// then its text between braces. A message is shown the way the settings
// stood where it is.
