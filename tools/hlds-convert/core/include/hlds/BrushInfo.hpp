// What each brush entity of a map is, as far as drawing and collision go.
//
// A brush entity is a piece of level geometry that belongs to an entity rather
// than to the world: a door, a grate, a pane of glass, a trigger volume. The
// map gives it a class and a handful of keys; this turns those into the few
// facts the DS needs -- is it drawn, how, and does the player bump into it.
//
// The drawing rules are the PC engine's (xash3d ref/gl/gl_rsurf.c,
// R_SetRenderMode):
//
//   rendermode 0  normal    opaque; "renderamt" is ignored
//   rendermode 1  colour    no texture: a flat "rendercolor" at renderamt
//   rendermode 2  texture   blended at renderamt; '{' texels with index 255
//   rendermode 3  glow        are holes
//   rendermode 5  additive  (the DS cannot add; drawn as a blend)
//   rendermode 4  solid     full strength, '{' holes cut out
//
// and, for every mode but 0, an amount of 0 means NOT DRAWN AT ALL. Mappers
// use that constantly -- 431 brushes in the campaign -- for walls that must
// stop the player and not be seen, so "invisible" and "not solid" are separate
// facts here.
