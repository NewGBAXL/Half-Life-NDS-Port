// Where the people and monsters of the game's maps stand, and where they
// walk: nobody inside the world.
//
// Every map from the tram ride to the first fights is cooked and started;
// each actor that stands on its feet must have room for its hull where the
// map puts it. Then the map is left to run for half a minute -- the scripts
// that start by themselves send people walking -- and on no frame may anyone
// who is WALKING be inside the world.
//
// (Someone a script has put on its mark may well overlap what is there: the
// scientist leaning on the lobby's desk has his hull in the desk, as he does
// in the game. Marks are the map's business; getting to them is ours.)
//
