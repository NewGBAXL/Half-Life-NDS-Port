"""place.py <in.bsp> <out.bsp> <x> <y> <z> <yaw>

A copy of a map of the game's in which the player starts where they are
told to: every info_player_start is moved there and turned that way. The
real game has no command that puts the player at a place, and this is how
a reference run begins at the same spot as a run of the port.

Only the entity text is changed. (A BSP's header is a version and fifteen
{offset, length} pairs; the entities are the first. The new text is put at
the end of the file and the pair pointed at it.)
