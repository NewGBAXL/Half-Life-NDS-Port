// The suit's lamp, by the game's rules: it wants the suit; its battery lasts
// about two minutes alight and is full again twenty seconds after it is put
// out; at nothing it goes out by itself.
//
// What it does to the picture is the game's too: a light eighty units
// across its half, at the point the middle of the view meets, the same size
// however far off that is; brightest at its middle and fading evenly to its
// edge; as bright as it gets out to five hundred units and fainter beyond.
// The game ADDS it to the wall's own light, so that the wall is seen
// brighter; here the wall is drawn again towards its own colour at full
// light (the lamp pass), which is the nearest this hardware comes to that
// -- and a light of the hardware's own falls on whoever stands in it
// (lampOn).
//
// std-only and inline: the host tests run it.
