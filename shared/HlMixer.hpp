// Who gets a voice. The console can play fourteen things at once (sixteen
// channels, less the music's and the one whose clock a DSi's sound capture
// keeps time by). Thirteen of them are voices; the fourteenth is kept back
// for a voice that is being faded out, so that one sound can give way to
// another without a click. What there is to play is of five kinds -- layers
// (HlSound.hpp) -- that are not equally worth hearing. These are the rules;
// what actually makes the noise is the caller's.
//
//  * Each layer has a SHARE of the voices that is its own: the player's own
//    sounds 3, the world's 4, the voice 2 (two people may speak at once),
//    the loops of a place 3, the menu 1. A layer is never left with fewer
//    than its share because another wanted more.
//  * While voices are free, any layer may have them, over its share or not.
//  * With none free, a layer still under its share takes one back from a
//    layer that is over its own: the least of them first (ambience, then the
//    world, the player, the voice, the menu), and of that layer's the
//    quietest, the oldest among equals.
//  * A layer at its share (or over) has only its own to take: the quietest,
//    if the new sound is at least as loud; otherwise the new sound is not
//    heard. The voice and the menu always take their own: a new line cuts in
//    on the last (which of two lines gives way is the speaker's business:
//    whoever plays them stops that one first).
//
// Each layer has a volume of its own, 0 to 10, set by the player.
//
// std-only and inline: the host tests run it.
