// Which of the brush entities in view a pass draws (WorldDraw::planBrushes,
// drawBrushes), kept apart from the drawing so that it can be tried on the PC.
//
// The solid ones -- doors, lifts, trains, what moves and what must not be
// missing -- are listed nearest first and drawn in that order; once one does
// not fit, nothing farther is drawn either: a near door is never left out
// while a far brush is drawn. The see-through ones are listed farthest first,
// as they must be drawn. When there are more of either than a list holds,
// the farthest are the ones left out, not whichever came last in the map.
