// Going from one map to the next.
//
// A Half-Life chapter is a string of maps joined end to end. Where two meet,
// each has an info_landmark of the same name at what is the same place in
// both, and the player who walks into a trigger_changelevel in one arrives in
// the other standing as far from its landmark as they were from the first's,
// moving the same way and looking the same way.
//
// The DS cannot hold two maps at once, so everything that crosses is put in
// one small struct -- the Arrival -- before the old map is let go, and applied
// once the new one is up. Names mean nothing across maps as ids (those are
// per map), so everything here that names something does so by nameHash().
//
// Also here: the GLOBAL STATES, the few named switches that outlive a map
// (env_global), which travel in the same struct.
//
// std-only and inline: the host tests run it.
