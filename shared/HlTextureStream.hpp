// Streaming a map's textures through a fixed part of video memory.
//
// A texture is in one of four states: ABSENT (drawn as its flat
// colour), STAGED (read from the card, waiting for the next vertical blank to
// be copied in), RESIDENT, and FAILED (could not be placed; it is let alone
// until the next demand pass). Some textures are PINNED: resident for good,
// what every view wants (a map whose textures all fit pins them all, and then
// nothing is ever evicted, which is what keeps a small map exactly as it was).
//
// The rest are wanted by SCORE, set by whoever knows what is in view
// (addScore). rebuild() takes the few that are wanted and not here, best
// first, as a queue; plan() takes them off it a few at a time within a
// budget of bytes. When there is no room, a resident texture makes way if
// its score is less than HALF of the wanted one's: what is nearly as wanted is
// left alone, or two textures would take each other's place for ever. If
// evicting what may be evicted would still not make room, nothing is evicted
// (it would only have to load again).
//
// Two areas of memory, each an arena of its own: the texels (for a 4x4
// compressed texture, with its index words, which sit where the texels' place
// says; the console works that out), and the palettes.
