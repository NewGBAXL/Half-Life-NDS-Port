// Who is drawn, of the map's actors, when not everything fits a frame.
//
// The hardware takes so many polygons a frame and no more, and the models
// have a share of that. The rule here: an enemy that is alive and in view
// is ALWAYS drawn, and so are the people of the place; what gives way for
// them is, in order, what matters least -- bodies and furniture, things to
// pick up, the far enemies' detail, the nearest's, the detail of the weapon
// in hand, and at the last a little of the world's far end. (It used to be
// "nearest first, whatever it is": a medkit at the player's feet could cost
// them the sight of the headcrab behind it.)
//
// And what "in view" means follows the shape of the thing: a barnacle is a
// mouth on the ceiling and a tongue that hangs to the floor, and is in view
// if any of that is.
//
// std-only and inline: the host tests run it (test_drawplan).
