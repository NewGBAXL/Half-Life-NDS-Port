// The actors' long thinking, done outside the frame (HlActors.hpp,
// ThinkQueue): a question an actor has asked -- its way somewhere -- worked
// out by the same code that would have worked it
// out in its tick, and its answer left for the actor to take up.
//
// On the console a worker of the 3D engine's runs thinkRunOne while the
// frame waits for the screen (source/game/Think.cpp), stopping now and then
// (thinkYield) so as never to hold the frame up for long. Here it is only
// the work, std-only: the host's tests run it between ticks.
